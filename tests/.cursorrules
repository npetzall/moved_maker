# Test Rules

## Test Organization
- One integration test file per major feature area
- Use descriptive test function names: `test_<what>_<condition>_<expected_result>`
- Group related tests using modules or comments

## Test Fixtures
- Place test fixtures in `tests/fixtures/` directory
- Use descriptive fixture file names
- Keep fixtures minimal and focused

## Assertions
- Use `assert!`, `assert_eq!`, `assert_ne!` for simple checks
- Use `Result` return types for tests that can fail
- Provide clear failure messages in assertions

## Test Data
- Use realistic but minimal test data
- Avoid hardcoding paths - use `PathBuf` and relative paths
- Clean up any temporary files created during tests
