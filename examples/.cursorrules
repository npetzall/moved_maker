# Example Terraform Files Rules

## Example Structure
- Each example should be self-contained and runnable
- Include realistic but minimal Terraform configurations
- Use clear, descriptive resource names
- Include comments explaining the example's purpose

## File Organization
- Follow standard Terraform file naming: `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `outputs.tf`, `data.tf`, `locals.tf`
- Group related resources logically
- Use consistent formatting (run `terraform fmt`)

## Documentation
- Include a README.md in each example directory explaining:
  - What the example demonstrates
  - How to run it
  - Expected output
- Add comments in Terraform files for complex logic

## Testing Examples
- Examples should be valid Terraform syntax
- Avoid requiring real cloud credentials (use data sources or mock resources)
- Keep examples focused on demonstrating tool functionality
