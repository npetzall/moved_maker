"""Integration tests for pr-labels package."""
# Integration tests would require GitHub token and actual repository access.
# For now, this file serves as a placeholder and documents the integration test approach.
#
# To run integration tests:
# 1. Set GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable
# 2. Set GITHUB_REPOSITORY environment variable (e.g., "owner/repo")
# 3. Set PR_NUMBER environment variable
# 4. Run: uv run pytest tests/test_integration.py
#
# Note: Integration tests should be run manually or in CI with appropriate permissions.
# Unit tests with mocks provide the primary test coverage.

    # Integration tests would test the full flow:
    # 1. Initialize GitHubClient with real token
    # 2. Get real PR from repository
    # 3. Apply labels
    # 4. Verify labels were applied correctly
