# Planning Documents Rules

## Document Naming and Organization
- Use `REQ_` prefix for requests (features, enhancements, modifications)
- Use `BUG_` prefix for bug reports
- Newly create documents should be placed in `plan/XX_Backlog` (literal folder name, not a placeholder)
- Both REQ_ and BUG_ documents get implementation plans in `work/` folder
- No `done/` folders - use status headers instead
- See REQ_WORK_DOCUMENT_STRUCTURE.md for complete structure guidelines
- Note: `XX_Backlog` is primarily used by rules for new documents; year-week directories (e.g., `YYWW/`) are created manually by users

## Workflow
1. **Discovery** → Add to `plan/XX_Backlog/` with `REQ_` or `BUG_` prefix (literal folder name)
2. **Planning** → Manually move to `plan/YYWW/` (year-week directory, e.g., `24W48/`), review and improve (manual step done by user)
3. **Implementation** → After review/refinement, when requested by user, create matching file in `work/` folder with same folder name and same filename
   - Example: `plan/YYWW/REQ_EXAMPLE.md` → `work/YYWW/REQ_EXAMPLE.md`
   - Example: `plan/XX_Backlog/BUG_SOMETHING.md` → `work/XX_Backlog/BUG_SOMETHING.md`
4. **Completion** → Update status to "✅ Complete" in `plan/` document (leave in place)

## Template Usage
- Always read and use templates from `.cursor/templates/` before generating documents:
  - REQ_ documents → `.cursor/templates/req_template.md`
  - BUG_ documents → `.cursor/templates/bug_template.md`
  - Implementation plans → `.cursor/templates/implementation_plan_template.md`
- Templates define all document structure, sections, formatting, and status header placement
- Follow template structure exactly - do not add or remove sections
