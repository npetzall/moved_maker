# Planning Documents Rules

## Document Structure
- Use REQ_ prefix for requests, BUG_ prefix for bug reports
- Include status header at the top: **Status**: 📋 Planned | 🟡 In Progress | ✅ Complete | ⏸️ Blocked
- Start with Overview section: current state, problem statement, or requirements
- Include clear task breakdowns
- Provide implementation details and examples
- Document benefits and considerations

## Template Usage
- Always read and reference templates from `.cursor/templates/` directory before generating documents
- For REQ_ documents, read `.cursor/templates/req_template.md` and use it as a starting point
- For BUG_ documents, read `.cursor/templates/bug_template.md` and use it as a starting point
- For implementation plans, read `.cursor/templates/implementation_plan_template.md` and use it as a starting point
- Adapt templates to the specific context while maintaining structure
- Implementation plans are created in `work/` folder with the same filename as the `plan/` document

## Markdown Formatting
- Use clear headings (## for main sections, ### for subsections)
- Use code blocks with language identifiers
- Include file paths and line numbers when referencing code
- Use lists for task items and considerations

## Content Guidelines
- Be specific and actionable
- Include references to GitHub issues when applicable
- Document file locations that need changes
- Provide examples of expected outcomes
- Note any breaking changes or migration steps
