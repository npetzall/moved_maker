# Implementation Plan: [Feature/Fix Name]

**Status**: 📋 Planned | 🟡 In Progress | ✅ Complete | ⏸️ Blocked

## Overview
[Brief description of what will be implemented]

## Checklist Summary

### Phase 1: [Phase Name]
- [ ] 0/2 tasks completed

### Phase 2: [Phase Name]
- [ ] 0/3 tasks completed

### Phase 3: [Phase Name]
- [ ] 0/2 tasks completed

[Add additional phases as needed. Update task counts as tasks (not sub-tasks) are completed. Each task may contain multiple sub-tasks with their own checkboxes.]

## Context
[Reference to corresponding REQ_ or BUG_ document in plan/ folder]
[Current state, problem statement, or requirements]

## Goals
- [Primary goal 1]
- [Primary goal 2]
- [Additional goals as needed]

## Non-Goals
- [What is explicitly out of scope]

## Design Decisions

**Important**: Document all key architectural and implementation decisions here. This section should explain the "why" behind major choices, not just the "what".

- **[Decision 1]**: [Description of the decision]
  - **Rationale**: [Why this approach was chosen]
  - **Alternatives Considered**: [What other options were evaluated and why they were rejected]
  - **Trade-offs**: [Any compromises or limitations]

- **[Decision 2]**: [Description of the decision]
  - **Rationale**: [Why this approach was chosen]
  - **Alternatives Considered**: [What other options were evaluated and why they were rejected]
  - **Trade-offs**: [Any compromises or limitations]

[Add additional design decisions as needed]

## Implementation Steps

**Note**: Implementation steps should be organized into phases. Each phase contains multiple tasks with checkboxes to track progress. Each task should be broken down into detailed sub-tasks with individual checkboxes. Phases should be logically grouped and can be completed sequentially or in parallel where appropriate.

**Important**: An implementation plan is considered complete when all AI-actionable tasks are finished. Do NOT include human-only tasks such as:
- Manual testing (beyond what can be automated)
- Code review
- Merging to main
- Release activities

These are post-implementation activities handled by humans. Focus only on tasks the AI can directly execute (code changes, automated test creation, documentation updates, etc.). When all AI-actionable tasks are complete, update the status to "✅ Complete" even if human activities remain.
