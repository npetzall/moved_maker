# Implementation Plans Rules

## Document Naming and Organization
- Implementation plans MUST be placed in a subfolder of `work/` with the same name as the folder where the corresponding REQ_ or BUG_ is located
- Filenames MUST be identical to the corresponding document in `plan/` folder
- Organize by matching the folder structure from `plan/` (e.g., `plan/YYWW/` → `work/YYWW/`, `plan/XX_Backlog/` → `work/XX_Backlog/`)
- Both REQ_ and BUG_ documents have matching implementation plans in `work/` folder
- No `done/` folders - use status headers instead
- See REQ_WORK_DOCUMENT_STRUCTURE.md for complete structure guidelines
- Implementation plans are created after review/refinement and when requested by user

## Relationship to Plan Documents
- Each file in `work/` corresponds to a file in `plan/` with the same folder name and same filename
- Always reference the corresponding `plan/` document at the beginning
- Implementation plans should align with requirements/scope defined in `plan/` documents
- Update status in both `plan/` and `work/` documents as work progresses

## Template Usage
- Always read and use `.cursor/templates/implementation_plan_template.md` before generating documents
- Template defines all document structure, sections, formatting, and status header placement
- Follow template structure exactly - do not add or remove sections
